# 2D_Game
A simple 2D arcade game implemented with C language and NCurses under Unix Kernel. It's a "player vs AI enemy" with many features usable from player to fight the enemy.


Most of the comments on the functions are written in Italian, but the sintax of all the project is all in English, so the "logic" is however understandable.
There is a rules file to create your own map readable from the game.
Running algo used from AI enemy = Dijkstra.

To execute the game on linux terminal (ubuntu) or bash shell(windows), run the follow command into terminal
  />./GAME1.0  
(Warning: maximizes the tarminal for a best experience)
